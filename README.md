WROLPi is a self-contained collection of software (on a Raspberry Pi) to help you survive the world Without Rule of Law.

WROLPi is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi with an optional external drive attached.  It serves up it's own wifi
network so that any person with a laptop/tablet/phone can connect and use the data previously collected by the user.


# Minimal Install
WROLPi runs in a couple Docker containers.  Lets get the prerequisites installed...
1. [Install docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/) and
    [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
1. Copy the latest WROLPi code
    * `git clone git@github.com:lrnselfreliance/wrolpi.git`
1. Change directory into the code base
    * `cd wrolpi`
1. Build the docker containers
    * `docker-compose build --parallel`
1. Start the docker containers
    * `docker-compose up`
1. Navigate to WROLPi
    * http://0.0.0.0:8080


# Charter
## Physical properties
1. A WROLPi instance should be capable of running with a minimal of hardware:
    * Raspberry Pi
    * SD card
    * External USB hard drive
    * Power supply and cables
    * WiFi USER device such as a phone, tablet, or laptop.
1. A WROLPi instance should consume a minimal amount of electricity during WROL event.  It is expected power will be
scarce when WROLPi is needed most.
## User expectations
1. A WROLPi instance should be run and maintained by a person (MAINTAINER) with a moderate amount of Linux and
Raspberry Pi experience.  It is expected that they should be able to do this using only the documentation on their
WROLPi.
## Software properties and capabilities
1. A WROLPi instance should be able to "factory-reset" itself without any outside services.
1. WROLPi should function completely without any internet services.
1. A user should have easy access to their data if WROLPi fails:
    * For example, a user can watch their videos by navigating a short and intuitive directory structure and opening the
      video in their preferred video player.
1. WROLPi should be self-documented.  The UI should contain a tutorial for USERS as well as the MAINTAINER.
    * If the UI isn't functional, the code should be documented such that a user can restore functionality.
1. WROLPi should favor pre-processing, rather than processing during a WROL event.  Such as re-encoding a video, or
processing captions.  This is to ensure that when a user adds content during non-WROL time, the processing for optimum
performance is already done for a WROL event.
